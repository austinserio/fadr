2.) Add animation support by adding animate.css and wow.js to the head of your HTML document
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.2/animate.min.css">
```
```
<script type="application/javascript" src=“fadr-master/wow.js”</script>
```

3.) Add Fadr.js script to the bottom of your HTML document
```
<script type="application/javascript" src=“fadr-master/fadr.js”</script>
```
  
3.) Add class “element-header” to each HTML individual item to be animated
